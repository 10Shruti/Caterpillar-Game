# Snake Game  

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Turtle graphics.  

## How to Play  

- Use the following controls to navigate the snake:  
  -   ^: Move the snake up  
  -   v: Move the snake left  
  -   '>': Move the snake down  
  -   <: Move the snake right  
- The objective is to eat as many red "leaves" as possible to grow longer.  
- Avoid colliding with the screen edges or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.  
- Your score increases by 10 each time the snake eats a leaf.
